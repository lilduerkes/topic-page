                    <p>What is Endometriosis. Endo is a disorder in which the uterine lining (endometrium) grows outside of the uterine cavity. It can grow on any organ in the body but is most found on tissues around your pelvic region including ovaries and bowels.  

                        The cause of Endometriosis is mainly unknown. But there are studies being done that might have to do with retrograde menstruation. Which happens when cells leak through the fallopian tubes. How this happens is unknown but there are many factors including immune response, genetic and environmental factors that could cause this to happen. </p>
